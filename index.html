      For #1, we have Gabi, who gave me the nickname "Superstar," which I separated into "Super" and "Star" to make the name sound better. Although Gabi has left my island [sadge &#128546], Gabi will never be forgotten as her legacy has continued on through Beau and Alice.

     For #2, we have Broffina, who gave me the nickname "Swanky." Honestly, I didn't want her when she randomly came to my island, but I somehow became close friends with her. I still don't want her though so she needs to go [&#128128].

      Last but not least, for #3, we have Wolfgang, who gave me the nickname "Peanut" [good thing I'm not allergic to nuts]. I really like Wolfgang, he was the second villager I invited to live on my island.
